## Research Experience
### Early Stage Detection and Classification of Colon Cancer using Deep Learning on Histopathological Images

This research endeavors to create a robust Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system designed to discriminate between different tissue cells, specifically focusing on distinguishing benign colon tissues from colon cancer tissues. Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were employed to analyze histological slides, with a primary focus on colon adenocarcinomas and benign cells. The study involved the development and implementation of a CNN architecture, carefully tailored to the unique characteristics of digital pathology images. By utilizing the inherent capabilities of CNNs, the system aimed to automatically classify and distinguish between various tissue cell types with a particular emphasis on improving diagnostic accuracy in the context of colon pathology.

## Projects
### Segementation of various parts of the Human Pelvis via YOLOv8 deep learning object detection model

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Car Rental Management System 

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
