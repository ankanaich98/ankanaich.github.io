## Research Experience
### Early Stage Detection and Classification of Colon Cancer using Deep Learning  and Explainable AI on Histopathological Images

This research endeavors to create a robust system designed to discriminate between different tissue cells, specifically focusing on distinguishing benign colon tissues from colon cancer tissues. Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** were employed to analyze histological slides, with a primary focus on colon adenocarcinomas and benign cells. The study involved the development and implementation of a small CNN model and CNN architectures such as **VGG16** and **RESNET50**. To enhance model understanding and accuracy, optimization strategies, Explainable AI methods like **LIME**, was employed. By utilizing the inherent capabilities of CNNs, the system aimed to automatically classify and distinguish between various tissue cell types with a particular emphasis on improving diagnostic accuracy.

## Projects
### Segmentation of Distinct Components within the Human Pelvis using Deep Learning Object Detection Model on X-Ray Images

Leveraging the power of the **YOLOv8** Object Detection Model, we have successfully achieved precise segmentation of various components within the human pelvis. The model, custom-trained on X-Ray images, exhibits exceptional performance when presented with user inputs, effectively segmenting distinct parts of the human pelvis. Complementing this advanced detection capability is a user-friendly interface crafted with **Django**, enhancing the overall user experience. This integrated solution seamlessly combines cutting-edge object detection technology with a sophisticated user interface, ushering in a new era of efficient and precise pelvic segmentation in medical imaging.
